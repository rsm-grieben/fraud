This repository details the creation of an advanced algorithm designed to detect credit card fraud, analyzing a dataset of 97,852 credit card transactions from a US government entity in 2010. Fraud pattern in credit card transaction is phenomena that evolves rapidly as fraudsters change their strategies and behaviors over time.

The process began with a thorough examination of the data, identifying and correcting anomalies and filling in missing information, particularly in merchant numbers and states, to ensure data integrity for accurate fraud detection. Also, we separated the dataset into three distinct parts: A training set, and a test set. Those datasets are used to train and build a model using past data. We then keep the last 2 months of transaction as an “out-of-time” – validation set. This out-of-time validation tests the model against new and unseen data. As our fraudsters techniques evolves rapidly, we generally keep the latest transactions to confirm the efficiency of our model.

In developing the fraud detection model, we employed feature engineering to create over 3,000 variables from different combinations of data points, such as card numbers and transaction locations. These variables capture key transaction metrics, but only the top 20 most influential ones were selected using advanced filtering techniques. These were then analyzed through a machine learning model, the LGBM Classifier, which proved to be highly effective in identifying fraudulent transactions without overfitting. In facts, in the top 3% of transactions in our out-of-time (unseen data), it catches 73% of the fraudulent transactions.

The deployment of this model demonstrated significant financial benefits, saving the organization approximately $40 million annually by detecting fraud. While there are minor losses due to incorrect fraud alerts, amounting to about $400,000, the net gain is substantial. Moving forward, it is imperative to continue refining the model through additional machine learning strategies and regular updates to adapt to new fraud patterns, ensuring the model's long-term effectiveness and accuracy.
